## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I create blog posts and open source packages mainly about python and data engineering.  I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others a public as possible.  You can see a full list of what I am up to on [https://keepgrowing.in/](https://keepgrowing.in/). If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to share it.

I believe in creating software with passion, craftsmanship, care and joy. Iâ€™m convinced that adherence to good practices doesnâ€™t ruin deadlines and budgets, but saves them instead. Itâ€™s true that ideal code is too broad a concept to capture but I believe it is still worth chasing â€“ and I chase it since the first line I wrote.
